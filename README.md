### Khaled Yamout

Name: Khaled Yamout
Student ID: s3805942

Born and raised in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia a city that was raised from the barren sands of the desert. Originally from Lebanon, enrolled at the Oxford multinational school where the first steps towards higher education began. Passionate about acting and film since childhood, after graduating from high school traveled to Lebanon to peruse an education in media studies at the Lebanese American University. In university learning so many skills and understanding progress in technology, observant that media in Lebanon was still in its most basic form. Graduated from (LAU) in 2014 to be able to continue studies abroad however, things did not go as planned. Obliged to stay, worked at an advertising company back in Riyadh where gaining work experience and profit took most of the focus from the real objective. Finally realizing the importance of going after a goal after 2 years. Applied to many production companies. There was a project in Jeddah where there was a possibility of a great position and recruitment. After the month of working on the project, the company decided to accept enlistment. A week after acceptance, managed to contact the company again asking for further detail. The company unprofessionally declined to answer and gave an intolerable excuse. A small time local production company then accepted enrollment. In the 3 months of learning all manner of aspects in media and production. The refusal of the pay rate they were offering ended in disappointment and withdrawal. After a grinding year trying to find a good job, grasped that it was time to try something new. Traveled back to Lebanon where freelancing in media gave the rise to widen and expand the skills needed. After struggling from job to job, the love for computers and technology sparked an intrigue. Now trying to study once again in the hopes of finding a stable workflow and understanding what I.T. is can reveal new opportunities.

### Patrick Mugasa

My name is Patrick Mugasa, my student number is s3792796 and I’m a member of group 20 (Our name is Penta). I finished my high in 2012 and was admitted to study electrical engineering and computer science at the university of New South Wales (UNSW). I studied there for 2 years however, I did not finish my studies due to work commitment. During my studies I was introduced to a lot of IT fields from digital circuit design to programming in assemblies and other languages. I have some experience programming in different paradigms including functional and object oriented. I love programming as it helps me create some useful apps and among the languages I have learnt over the years include C, C#, Haskell, Java and Python. Recently, I decided to join RMIT to continue my studies in IT and I’m looking forward to finishing my studies. Studying at RMIT online helps me keep my job but study at the same time and this was the issue I had with my previous studies. My other interests in IT include networking and artificial intelligence. After finishing my degree in IT, I’m planning to be CCIE certified in both security and routing and switching. I’ve been told that CCIE is one of, if not the hardest exam in networking and I’m looking up to that challenge.  Apart from my academic life, I’m a bit introverted and love guitars. I’m currently learning how to play the guitar and my favorite artist is Erik Mongrain. When I’m not studying or working, I spend most of my time playing FIFA on my Xbox.

My name is Tayla Jean Surmon I am 24 years old. I was born and bred in Cairns, Far North Queensland. I completed my year 12 certificate at St Marys Catholic College in 2012. During my years at high school I had the burning desire to move into higher education and complete a degree in occupational once I completed my year 12 certificate, however I put that on hold took a gap year and unfortunately didn’t follow that desire, instead found happiness in working as a gymnastics coach (which I had already been doing since 2007) . My Mum was born in Sydney, however had the opportunity to travel far and wide as her dad was a plane engineer. My Dad is from Papua New Guinea and moved to Sydney Australia at the age of 6. I have 3 Older brothers all of which were born in Sydney. My first and only spoken language is English, however I would like to learn Japanese in the future. Between 2016 and the beginning of 2019 I worked as an insurance broker and gained my Tier 2 in General Insurance Broking. Currently I am working in a bank and in the process of completing my Tier 2 in Banking. I have a dog named Bruce and a cat named Mitsy who I absolutely adore. Up until 2013 I was a Gymnast/Trampolinist and extremely enjoyed it. My early retirement from Gymnastics/Trampolining came in 2013 when I decided that my knees and body was no longer able to take the harsh impact of the sport. 7 years later I decided it was time to jump back into full-time study and am now in the process of completing my Diploma of Business (Financial Planning).

Since a young age I have been in the workforce. Slowly becoming more experienced with my work I noticed that I would need to educate myself beyond a high school level. Many of my problems arise from trying to learn how to maintain the business, keeping up with the finances and making critical decisions. At this stage of my life I found that the best thing for me would be to do a Bachelors course in Financial Planning. This would be helping me directly in my work. I decided to go through my options as I have to go in to work from Monday to Friday even the weekends sometime. Working nine to five can be a lot of work and trying to go into class would be near impossible. So I decided to take up Open University. This would help me work and I would still be able to do my course. After finishing my course I feel as if I would have a lot more skill set to bring into my future problems. I will be able to help myself personally and career wise

## Report

### Team Ideal Jobs What makes them differnet and Similar (Group Skill Set)

Our ideal jobs have many similarities and differences nonetheless, it is crucial to know what they are to realize each other’s objective. There are so many functions a computer can produce though, it all differs on what, how, and which job requires a certain outcome. For instance Tayla has experience in accounting, Commerce/Banking, and consulting or advising. In her case she would need to use a computer to organize all her work and save financial data and client information. As mentioned earlier a computer not only helps organize workflow and save data but can function to create and produce works of art. Khaled a film student utilizes the computer to edit videos and so much more. Recently studying I.T. and computer sciences made him recognize that coding and programing can help him achieve things in design that were not discovered yet in his previous studies. Patrick who has an interest in Networking would use a computer in order to configure routers, troubleshooting any problems with the network, WAP’s, and help in many other ways to improve and make sure internet is accessible and smooth. The general skills rank that our group has, covers all the necessary abilities to be able to complete ordinary yet still important tasks like sending a professional email. Our I.T. skills are still being practiced in order to advance into pro. stages. Our I.T. skills till now only cover the very basic foundation of I.T. data and development. The highest I.T. specific skills that are not available now would be professional coding, programing, and maintenance. After reviewing the data from Burning Glass, we concluded that over the years job demands change and that being able to study and learn the importance of all I.T. skills would make it easier for the future job applicants.   


## I.T. and What it Involves
### Interviews and Video sources

Michael Iskandarani
Web Developer
1.	What kind of work is done by I.T. professionals?
The work that I.T. professionals do is so vast that they can be anything from developing, programing, and designing so many different applications, programs, web sites, software, and even hardware.
2.	What kind of people do I.T. professionals work with?
We work with all manner of people, especially those who need advice and or work done for their companies. They are usually clients who want to develop an app or a website for their business furthermore, we also work within our own workspace to improve and make our own internal systems more efficient.
3.	Where does an I.T. professional spend most of their time?
In front of a computer of course. Whether it is in an office, at home, at home or even at a café. We are always in front of a screen and if a P.C. or laptop is not enough, we also have our phones as well.
4.	What aspect of the position is most challenging?
The most challenging thing in my field is probably being able to code without having any setbacks. I try my best to present my work at the end of the day without making any mistakes, that’s why I always double and triple check my work before showing it to anyone. Though no matter how hard you check sometimes there will always be something that malfunctions and that’s why you always have to be prepared to fix the error. 

Aya Hawa
Software Developer
1.	What kind of work is done by I.T. professionals?
Those who work In I.T. are responsible for organizing, programing, and maintaining a computer. We mostly work with data, networking, applications, and making programs that help make a computer easier to use.
2.	What kind of people do I.T. professionals work with?
We work and interact with many people, anyone who is interested in technology and developing programs and or applications are all potential clients. We work with investors, cooperate companies, and even small businesses.
3.	Where does an I.T. professional spend most of their time?
As a person working for a company, I spend most of my time in the office in front of a computer. I bet that many other people spend a lot of time in front of a computer at work but for us it’s more than just using a computer to get something done. We use our computers to create and make things that people need and want instead of just using it to send emails and collect data. 
4.	What aspect of the position is most challenging?
As a Software Developer the most challenging thing is getting through all the coding correctly. That’s why when I am working I try to organize all my codes so that I don’t get confused. It takes time but well worth the time to fix and keep things from getting confusing.

Joyce Kanaya
Software Engineer      
1.	What kind of work is done by I.T. professionals?
Their jobs is to either handle or care for a computer or to be able to use the computer to create and make things like apps and more.
2.	What kind of people do I.T. professionals work with?
We mostly work with clients that come by the company and request projects that the company accepts from them. It is either app development or network based web development that mostly sought after.
3.  Where does an I.T. professional spend most of their time?
Well that is obvious, in front a computer unless it’s a weekend.
4. What aspects of the position is most challenging?
The most challenging thing is being able to present our work to the client on time with a great presentation. We deal with a lot of people and we want them to feel great working with us and mostly satisfied with the work we do for them. Though not everyone could be pleased, there are other clients who are very tough to deal with and are very demanding. Not knowing how much work we put in or not appreciating what we do, some clients just want to spend the least they can and get the most work out of us. Thankfully our company knows how to handle all sorts of people, the good thing is that some of us work with a computer more than dealing with people. That’s why some of us study business and others study computers.


I.T. Profession
There is a variety of things an I.T. professional does from impersonal remote support in a small business or a large enterprise company. An I.T. support specialist makes sure that an organization’s technological equipment is running smoothly.
This is a list of important roles an I.T. Pro does.

•	Managing 
•	Installing
•	Maintaining
•	Troubleshooting 
•	Configuring office equipment/computers

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLqd5cSSnEc

What an I.T. Manager does
An I.T. manger has so many things to do, depending on the size and the industry/company he/she is working in. I.T. manger can also go by many different titles as well, such as;

•	I.T. operations manager
•	I.T. Infrastructure manager 
•	Service delivery manager
•	Account manager (focused on Tech.)

In general an I.T. manager is responsible for everything that has to do with technology. Making sure that the servers are healthy and network is good. Making sure that security is strong and that patching is happening. All of the infrastructure is being monitored to be able to fix any problems that were to pass. I.T. professionals also work with vendor providers to get the latest and best hardware and software for the company/organization. Being able to keep communications going and making sure Internet Service Providers (ISP’s) are giving the best possible internet and phone coms for the business. In very large companies the I.T. department that is in-house is divided into sections where each section has a job to fulfill within the company, examples are; the developing section who are responsible for making programs and apps for the company or maintenance who take care of all the tech especially making sure all computers are maintained and functional. Businesses also deal with remote I.T. services if they do not have an in-house department. Team work is essential in large companies but, in small businesses a person or two are accountable for all the tasks mentioned above since it is smaller and manageable with two or even one person.

## Technology That Impact The World


## Robots

### Khaled Yamout

In the 80’s Robots were a thing of science fiction, they were made fun of on the T.V. when watching an old black and white film that featured a robot. Now a days Robots manufacture and help us in so many ways in our daily lives. A robot by definition is defined as a machine that resembles a living creature by being able to move independently and performing complex tasks such as grasping or moving objects. Micheal B. Merriam Webster, Definition of Robot, Retrieved from https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/robot.
Robots were not in use until the 20th century but, the mention and the use of automation was described way before recent times. It is said that the ancient Greeks and many other civilizations used machines or “Machina” to do several tasks to make their lives easier, this was the beginning of the creation of robotics though none of the automated machines endured for proof. Thomas, History of Robotics, Retrieved from https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/automation-electronics/history-of-robotics/ .
In the Middle Ages in Europe and the Middle East automation was mostly used to make clocks and machines for ceremonial practices. There were descriptions of machines in the Arab polymath of Al Jazari (1136-1206) that indicate a large moving elephant clock that sounded every hour, a musical robot, and an automaton waitress that served drinks. (Thomas, History of Robotics) When robots were engineered in the 18th century people called them “Automata” or “Automatons” that took the form of living creatures and moved like them, also performed actions like them. (Thomas, History of Robotics) During the Industrial Revolution so many wonders of mechanics were being built for experiment and production to make tasks easier. Unfortunately not everything that was engineered at the time was successful at performing their jobs however, it kindled the minds of inventors and story makers alike. Racing N. (1880-1890), Victorian Secrets from Footnotes of History.
All the ruckus started with the creation of the steam powered man on March 24, 1868 where it is said to have the strength of 3 horses to pull a carriage. Racing N. (1880-1890). They made him look like a man so that it won’t scare other horses away but, there is another reason for making a “Robot” look human. People prefer it if robots looked human when undertaking tasks that resemble human behavior. Dr. Peter B. Why Do We Make Robots look like Humans? Retrieved from https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/why-do-we-make-robots-look-like-humans/.
The Robots of today have advanced so much since then. Today a lot of robots are used for industrial manufacturing and executing labor tasks more efficiently and faster than a person can, because some tasks are either too difficult for a human to do or too dangerous. Ticara G. What Robots Are Used Today? Retrieved from https://sciencing.com/what-robots-are-used-today-12745877.html  Robots are used by NASA for instance on expeditions to explore space and go to planets such as Mars. (Ticara G.) As for the medical field robots are used to perform surgeries that are extremely complex and delicate for a surgeon’s hands. (Ticara G.)
The most recent and most modern technology used in robots is Artificial Intelligence (A.I.). This technology will revolutionize the way robots behave and think. To be able to think and learn is the real focus and objective of this tech. It will allow robots to do tasks faster and more efficiently. Sanjit S. (Feb 25, 2019) Artificial Intelligence in Humanoid Robots, Retrieved from https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/02/25/artificial-intelligence-in-humanoid-robots/#19562af924c7. 
Making a robot in humanoid form was first made to see how to make better prosthetics for humans. (Sanjit S. Feb 25, 2019) Humanoids are now being used for so many reasons and not just or limited to research purposes. (Sanjit S. Feb 25, 2019) Now a days robots or more specifically humanoids are not only assisting with minimal tasks but rather taking on roles such as receptionist, personal assistant, and front desk officer. (Sanjit S. Feb 25, 2019) A.I. based interactions is what makes humanoids so unique. The way they receive information and are able to decipher commands, questions, and even reply in a witty manner makes them closer and closer to becoming more “human”. (Sanjit S. Feb 25, 2019)
A great example of humanoid robotics is Sophia the world’s first robot citizen, she was created by Hanson Robotics where she was presented to the United Nations on October 11, 2017. She was then given a citizenship by Saudi Arabia on October the 25th, where she became the first robot citizen. (Sanjit S. Feb 25, 2019)
The impact of this technology is already in effect, if robots are taking the roles of assisting people in day to day tasks. Then this technology is going to radically alter how humans will interact with it in the future. Depending on the tasks that Robots or humanoids are going to take in the near future could affect how everyone lives. If (A.I.) in the future can improve how robots perform in a human environment where robots take the responsibility of making sure our every needs are satisfied. Many current jobs can be replaced if given the chance to. Such as Bank clerk, receptionist, maid/butler, and the list can go on.   
A prediction to how robotics could change the future in the next 3 years could be anything. The sky is the limit when it comes to (A.I.) there is still so much a robot can be capable of, but only if we as humans grant them the permission and the means for it to evolve. If given the power to learn all that human-kind has done. Robots would be able to improve our life by perceiving faults in our day to day life. Scientist however want to limit the power of (A.I.) from learning everything. The reason for this is because they are afraid that if given the chance to learn everything, a Robot’s first primary thought would be to eliminate the problem. In this case the problem is human error, as seen in many Sci-Fi movies such as “I-Robot”. If Humanoids are already taking tasks that replace humans in some jobs like mentioned above, robots can impact our human way of life in such a drastic way that some people would be against it. The people who would need jobs and are replaced by robots are the ones who would be most affected by this movement.
In my day to day life, some tasks that prove to be annoying and arduous such as getting things from the store and or doing the laundry for instance are possible tasks for future robots that would help me. It will make my life easier to have a robot around that does not demand money for every trivial task done. Getting a Robot would help with tasks that a regular human would ask money for. In doing so would help to financially cut down on unnecessary spending, the question is, would this robot do the task better than a human would?. Members of my family would probably like the idea of help around the house, and chores like washing dishes and cooking being done by a robot. I believe that robotics can either be there to help, or make things worse for a lot of desperate people who need work but are given to robots instead. I’m trying to adapt with what’s to come however, with so much going on and the speed in which technology is changing the world, some of us might not be able to catch up.

## Cyber-Security

### Patrick Mugasa

Cybersecurity has never been as important as it is today. Everyday we hear about attacks against big and small companies as well as personal attacks. This section contains tools and techniques used by security professionals to fight against cyber attackers. One field that is dedicated to this issue is penetration testing.Penetration testing is the process of attacking a system to determine its vulnerabilities before a perpetrator in order to eliminate them to secure the system. In penetration testing a virtual lab is built containing Kali linux for testing purposes and ensures that access is limited to the local network. By limiting access, we can use testing tools such as test scans and probes that would otherwise be considered illegal on the internet. Virtualization is not only a good way to create a lab but also allows us to deal with potentially dangerous tools. By using virtualization, the tester can take snapshots of the system which would be used to recover the system just in case of a malware infection. Virtualization comes in two different forms, one of which is the type 1 hypervisor also known as bare metal hypervisor and the type 2 hypervisor known as the hosted hypervisor. The type 1 hypervisor is installed directly onto the computer hardware. Examples of the type 1 hypervisor are microsoft’s hyper-v hypervisor and Vmware’s esxi hypervisor. Type 2 hypervisors are installed to a hosting operating system and include vmware and oracle’s virtualbox.

Kali linux is a linux distribution that was built for security work and includes over 300 security testing tools. It is the new name of a security testing suite that started out called backtrack and is the most used tool in penetration testing. It contains information gathering tools about a target by probing the target directly. These include, gathering dns information to profile a target system and identifying any ids to filter traffic. One of the information gathering tools on Kali is dmitry (Deep magic information gathering tool). Dmitry can be used to look up hosts, identify subdomains and scan the target for open ports. The first thing that dmitry provides, is the target’s IP address followed by the target’s subdomains and finally the registration information of the target. Dmitry can also be used for port scanning by using the -p and -b switches on one of the target servers. Another tool for information gathering is the DNSenum which is a DNS analysis tool that is used to enumerate information for a system, identify subdomains and provide the associated mail servers. The first thing we get from dnsenum is the host’s address which is followed by its associated name servers. By using the -s and -p switches, we can also get the subdomain information from the dns servers. Kali also contains vulnerability analysis tools used for vulnerability testing. One of the vulnerability analysis tools provided by Kali is nikto which is mainly used for web scanning. It is used to scan for vulnerabilities in the underlying webserver. Running nikto gives us the type of the webserver, the missing features, the version of the server and then the vulnerabilities based on the open source vulnerability database (OSVDB). Another and one of the most important tool for vulnerability scanning is the OpenVAS (The open Vulnerability Assessment System) tool, however, it doesn’t come pre-installed on Kali. The user has to manually install OpenVAS. OpenVAS is usually run through its web interface. An OpenVAS scan shows a number of vulnerabilities and their severity. By clicking on the report link, we get a full report of all alerts raised and their solutions where solutions exist. The solution shows a number of possible fixes to the alert. We also get links to individual vulnerabilities with their detailed reports, their severity and the host address. Clicking on individual alert links, takes you to the page containing the details of that alert. This page shows a summary of the report, the vulnerability detection result and the vulnerability detection method.

Since everyone has access and uses the internet, it is important to teach people about penetration testing and also provide them with tools to help them protect themselves against cyber-attacks. People have to be taught to think like perpetrators in order to know how to protect themselves. Kali linux is available for free and can be obtained by anyone on the internet. Kali is a great tool however, it is not as popular as other operating systems like windows, mac or other linux distributions. Most people rely heavily on antiviruses on their pcs but with the rapid evolution of cyber-attacks, the antiviruses can’t keep up with every attack. Recently Microsoft announced that they will be embedding a linux kernel in the upcoming windows 10 which is a great step towards protection against these attacks. With a linux kernel, windows users will be able to install tools like OpenVAS which are good at detecting and eliminating these attacks.

Kali is a great and one of the best tools at protecting oneself against cyber-attacks, however it is not as popular as other operating systems. One other tool that is available to people that don’t use Kali is wireshark. Wireshark formerly known as ethereal is an open source package analysis tool that is used for network packet analysis, network troubleshooting and network traffic analysis. Packet analysis is important in troubleshooting network congestion, create firewalls and intrusion detection. Packet analysis is mostly done by network administrators. It is a big topic to cover and takes a lot of time to master however, knowing the basics is enough to protect oneself against attacks and the tool that is most used for this is wireshark. If people are not comfortable using Kali, they should at least invest in learning some basic wireshark for protection. In addition to wireshark, there are some other packet analyzers like Cain and Abel which recovers passwords and can record voice over ip conversations, dSniff which monitors traffic like emails, passwords, etc.  and Naruslnsight which monitors internet traffic. Although all these tools are great, the most used and recommended is wireshark

People need to be aware of cybersecurity issues and attacks. By raising awareness, people would be cautious about using the internet. Apart from raising awareness of cybersecurity, there needs to be free education and training about security. By providing free education, everyone would have access to the training material without any cost or barrier. People also need to be careful with what they post on social media as this is where attacks begin i.e. in the reconnaissance stage of an attack, the attacker usually uses information provided by social media or any other information that is publicly available. Penetration testing is a huge field that takes years to master but if people do learn about the two security tools (Kali linux and wireshark), the internet would be a secure place and everyone would know how to protect themselves against attacks. There would be less cyber criminals and people would feel safe while using the internet. For the people that need to specialize in security, there are courses like the CEH (Certified Ethical Hacker) by the EC-Council, CISM (Certified Information Security Manager), Comptia’s security+ and GSEC. I’m planning to learn some wireshark in the near future as I want to get CCIE certified in security. My family is ignorant about cybersecurity, but I try to remind them to visit secure websites to keep our network safe. They are not interested in learning either wireshark or Kali linux but once I get my CCIE in security, I will make sure that all their devices are secure.

From cruise control to parking assist, in the last few years we have seen an enormous escalation in technological developments being executed in the automotive industry.

The human population like to watch movies, don’t have much time to catch up on emails and tend to be a little bit sleep deprived. However, with the production of autonomous vehicles right around the corner people will be able to sit in their car watch movies, catch up on their emails and take a little nap. 

An Autonomous Vehicle, is also recognized as a robotic car, self-driving car or a driverless car. This is a vehicle that has the ability to sense its surrounding and move about with little to no human input. Instruments such as radar, lidar, sonar, GPS, inertial measurement units and odometry are all combined within the Autonomous Vehicles which enables them to observe their surroundings and move freely. Advanced control systems translate sensory data to recognize the appropriate navigation paths as well as any obstacles and signage which are essential to be avoided.

Autonomous vehicles are set to be as life-changing if not more life-changing then the invention of the motor vehicle itself. Many cities have been designed principally by the mobility that has been accomplished by motor vehicles. Motor vehicles have provided transportation services to people and supported many major road networks internationally since they were invented. 

Many people believe that the analogy of road networks are similar to blood vessels. Road networks give increase to movement and a measure of independence to people giving them the ability to drive from point A to point b and carry out their many social needs and wants as they deem necessary. With the production of Autonomous vehicles, they will make the road network or the blood vessels run more effectively, efficiently and safely. 

There is a need for autonomous vehicles to be supported as astonishing statics show that today’s motor vehicles are immensely uneconomical and hazardous. 
Research shows that there are around 1 million deaths on the roads worldwide each year. This equivalates to roughly 1 fatality every 30 seconds. Over 90% of these fatalities are caused by human error. Autonomous vehicles have the potential to reduce the amount of fatalities as it eliminates human imperfections in driving such as drivers not paying attention to the road in front of them, driving at high speeds (above the speed limits), drink driving, perceptual errors, judgement errors and driver exhaustion. 

Autonomous vehicles are capable of reducing up to 90% of wasted commuting, increasing car utilisation, reducing car ownership and also reducing CO2 emissions therefore also helping reduce global warming. 

Within the next few years companies such as Tesla, Toyota, Google, Lexus, BMW, Mercedes-Benz and many more will be arranging to introduce autonomous vehicles with a huge emphasis on the electrification of cars. With autonomous vehicles being produced and ready for sale to the public in the not so distant future we may start to see driver’s licences approach the obsolete status along with hot rod fuel guzzlers. 

Within the next 10-20 years the world can expect to see major changes in the way all roads and transport services are operated. This will also create new avenues for value creation in transport such as service and major upgrades in safety and efficiency.  

Although Autonomous Vehicles are equipped with Instruments such as radar, lidar, sonar, GPS, inertial measurement units and odometry there are proven difficulties when it comes to determining the intentions of pedestrians, cyclists and animals. 

Currently in Europe, Belgium, France, Italy and the United Kingdom are all planning to operate transport systems for autonomous vehicles. Germany, the Netherlands and Spain all currently allow the public to test autonomous vehicles on their roads. In 2015, the United Kingdom launched public trials of the LUTZ Pathfinder automated pod in Milton Keynes. At the beginning of the summer of 2015, the French government allowed PSA Peugeot-Citroen to make trials in real conditions within Paris. The association between the French companies THALES and Valeo (provider of the first self-parking car system) is testing its own system for Autonomous Vehicles. In New Zealand the government in planning to use automated vehicles for public transport in the cities of Tauranga and Christchurch. 

In China, Baidu and King Long produced the automated minibus, a vehicle containing 14 seats without a driver’s seat. With 100 vehicles produced by Baidu and King Long, 2018 was the first year with commercial automated services in China.

The era of autonomous vehicles is here. According to the automotive industry estimates, by 2020, the autonomous vehicle market will be worth around US$87 billion (AUD$124,410,000,000). Additionally, by the year 2040, it is projected that out of every 10 vehicles on the road 4 of them will be autonomous. Autonomous Vehicles will open up new opportunities and create motivation for innovation for organisations from across a wide range of industries not only within Australia but Worldwide as well.  

In the 2019 Autonomous Vehicles Readiness Index (AVRI) Australia dropped from 14th place to 15th place. The AVRI tested 25 countries on their preparedness to transition to driverless transport in multiple areas including policy, technology, infrastructure and customer acceptance. 

In 2017, both the public and private sector senates of the road industry of Australia decided that for Australia to meet the pace of technological progression, the Australian specialists were required to be ready to support the safe deployment of partially robotic vehicles by the year 2020 and highly automated and driverless automobiles by the year 2030. 

Unfortunately, with the world we are living in it won’t be long before your everyday manual and automatic cars are non-existent. Autonomous vehicles are the way of the future and within the next 1-5 years they will be everywhere. No more jobs for taxi drivers, bus drivers, truck drivers. All these people will lose their jobs because autonomous vehicles are being manufactured quicker and more frequently as the years go by. Companies will look to become more futuristic by buying autonomous vehicles to reduce their staffing costs. Unfortunately, this is something that we are unable to stop from happening. Not only will loss of jobs be affected but the technology to run the autonomous vehicles will be highly expensive. The world should also see a reduction in taxes as well as insurance collection. Although, these drawbacks will not be sufficient to halt the study and progression that is already underway. 

In relation to the effect that autonomous vehicles will have on me personally I believe that it is the way of the future and this is just the start to many autonomous things. I don’t 100% agree with autonomous vehicles but facts such as reducing fatalities worldwide, reducing CO2 emissions and assisting with reducing global warming I agree with the production of autonomous vehicles. However, I don’t agree with how this will affect people’s jobs and livelihoods.

## Cryto Currency

### Saad Alvi

The development of technology has sky rocketed over the years. These changes in society are making life more effortless. There is a lot of topics we can talk about but I find block chain and crypto currency the most intriguing.  I feel like it will change the whole economy of the world. It is a very complicated method but I have basically explained how the general way it is run.

Block chain programming was introduced by the founders of Bitcoin. It consists of many different computers working on a network through the internet to solve complex equations. When these complex equations are solved, the network will pay a fee to the computer which was able to solve the equation first. This process is called mining. 

Complex equations increase in complexity with every transaction which occurs on the network. As a group of users start to accept the fee as a form of payment, blockchain technology has now created a new acceptable medium of exchange, Cryptocurrency. The code which has now been mined could be used as a form  of exchange within an industry which accepts it as a payment.

The advantage of Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is the redundancy to ever needing to reconcile transactions. Rather than having to reconcile manually between a general ledger and the bank with the possibility of human error, the computers on a network simultaneously add a block to the Cryptocurrencies general ledger which every computer must agree all previous data is true to be finalised on the ledger. The computers which work to support the network are referred to as nodes.

The importance of this technology is once a transaction is added to the ledger, the transaction cannot be reversed and this prevents any data manipulation on previous transactions. This is because once every node has agreed on a block added to the chain, the historical data is now exists on every node within the network. The technology consists of an encrypted blocks being stored across every node on the network which is consistently eliminating any imperfections in the data.  The new coding opens a new method of storing data within a ledger which its possibilities are yet to be discovered. Implications of Blockchain can be implemented in any software or industry which requires information to be approved before being processed.

The uses of blockchain technology could be seen in certain industries which only accept payment in the form of its own cryptocurrency, which gives incentive to nodes on a network to continue to function as the fee being paid out will remain valuable. Initially, to obtain cryptocurrency was only through mining. Since the expansion of the networks, the operators of these nodes will sell their excess fees obtained through mining on exchanges. These exchanges accept Fiat Currency, which are government issued currency in exchange for Cryptocurrency. Exchanges such as CoinBase, CoinSpot, and Coin Jar allows you to trade in Fiat Currency for Cryptocurrency. 

An appealing aspect to a cryptocurrency is the inability for a certain industry to manipulate their value of their currency, a decentralised currency. When a currency is decentralised and consistently used within a network, every transaction which occurs on the ledger increases the complexity of the Equations, thus making it harder for the nodes to solve these equations and gradually decreasing the fee awarded to the node. The value of the Cryptocurrency then increases. 

Cryptocurrency could be seen in everyday technology, such as our daily transactions. Companies such as visa and mastercard are processing thousands of transactions per second and could use this type of technology to prevent the task of reconciliation. Potential Jobs which are affected are jobs within accounts as there will be less tasks involved around balancing general ledgers. Potential implications of this technology is the independency of needing to open an account with a bank, thus providing full control of the ones asset to the individual. 

Currently Cryptocurrency is highly volatile due to the limited amount of users actively using it as a form of exchange, but when the users are diverse, sudden changes within the market occurs it will not be as effective as it has been in the past. Currently the wealthier individuals are able to manipulate the market as they will invest enormous amounts of fiat money within a certain cryptocurrency causing many to rush in, then potentially exchanging cryptocurrency back out into fiat money and gaining capital. This leaves damaging effects to unsuspected users who have invested a lot of capital. 

As an individual, blockchain would potentially allow me to transfer funds to my family in another country without bank fees and exchange rates instantly. This allows more value to be received to my family and decreasing the processing time in urgent situations. When a transaction is sent, a fee is paid to the network to process this transaction, which further creates an incentive for the operators to continue to maintain their nodes. To receive these funds the requirement is access to the internet. Accounts are opened through wallets which have been encrypted by a string a words creating an encryption on the wallet and an address to send and receive. Unlike Bank accounts, we are not required to enter a branch and provide document proving identity to open a wallet. This is convenient for those who do not have the time or access to branch to open an account or are worried about the safety of their personal data being breached. 

Currently, if cryptocurrency is used as everyday transaction it will not have a great affect as all my transactions are through tap and pay using visa mastercard. The advantages of Cryptocurrency is the freedom to manage to send funds to instantly to any location with internet access but, if I was to move my assets entirely to a wallet through a decentralised currency I am liable for my own negligence. If another individual was to obtain access to my wallet I will not be able to process a claim through a bank to receive my funds back.

Project idea
I think the best way to implement this program into society would be to go through the government of the country. If we can make a regulation that every Pharmacist has to be using this program it will be easier then expecting everyone to be using the same program.  Also we wouldn’t have to spend time marketing and wasting resources on unnecessary projects. Getting a government grant would be the most ideal way of getting this program to help the country. Also since it will be a government application it would make it easier for doctors and hospitals to attain this information helping the whole medical world come closer. 


## Group Project Idea

### MISUSE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

In Australia the use of prescription drugs is an increasing problem. Pharmaceutical drugs have been the highest recurrent contributor to overdose deaths within Australia. Australians who are affected by the dependence of prescription drugs find themselves going from doctor to doctor and pharmacy to pharmacy every day to assist in feeding their addiction. In saying that, this project idea would need to be applied by pharmacists using a computer program that they all must. This program would provide them the ability to search using the customer’s details and find out where else they have been to collect this drug as well as when they last filled a prescription. This is a system that would need to be executed in every pharmacy in Australia and always be used to update the patient records of how often the drugs are being acquired and used. 
Not only is this a snowballing issue in Australia, but a worldwide issue which is a growing concern to all governments. A survey which was completed in 2013 found that 4.8% of Australian Adults were using prescription drugs for non-medical purposes. The amount of people in syringe and needle programs who have testified that the most recent drug they used to inject themselves with was a prescription opioid amplified from 7% in 2000 to 23% in 2015. This study also found that the 2 most commonly abused drugs were analgesics and sedatives. The reason these 2 drugs are the most commonly used is because they stimulate the reward section in the brain by increasing the level of dopamine neurotransmitter levels, which creates the feeling of pleasure and relief of dysphoria. 
By implementing this service to pharmacies, they would all need to have a protected internet connection which would be linked to a certain server which is based in the cloud. This server would be available 24 hours a day 7 days a week. This system would work by all pharmacists (or pharmacist assistants) inputting the details of all of their clients and the drug that was prescribed to them. Yes, this may take a bit of extra time for the pharmacist or pharmacist assistant, however it would assist in decreasing the abuse of prescription drugs. As this would be a live system that would be hosted by a government agency, all the data that is entered into the system would be live as soon as it is entered, thus there would be no down-time. If an abuser is going from doctor to doctor and pharmacy to pharmacy this would be an excellent program to guarantee that abusers aren’t able to feed their addictions by abusing the medical professions, as they would be red flagged in the system. 
If this program is implemented across the globe, it will help a lot of people who are in desperate situations to get back to better health and to return from being dependent on drugs. As mentioned before the computer program would track customer’s prescription orders to limit their use of prescription drugs. As soon as a person is flagged in the system, a response to the situation would be to send a qualified person from a rehabilitation centre with authority from the government. Helping the citizens get back to health is a major part in keeping a community strong and most of all safe. Rehabilitation centres would have personnel ready for tracking and escorting the addict in need back to the centre where they would get the proper care and help. Those who are flagged by the program would be listed in “red” meaning; in need of help. After the addict has received the care and rehabilitation they require from the centre, they would be released back into society as “green” meaning they have been rehabilitated and are now trying to return to a normal life style. The live system would then keep track of their state to make sure they do not relapse. This information will also help doctors determine who the patients are and what to do with their condition.       

This type of service would necessitate each pharmacy to have a securely connected computer, which the government would make compulsory to operate. Unfortunately, this means that pharmacies would have to invest a bit of money and time into obtaining these specialised computers or they would be unable to remain operating. As this service is a program that would hold sensitive information about customers, it is highly important that the software development for this program is exceedingly secure. 
There are many skills and talents that would be essential to make this project an effective one. Everything from project managers, software developers and computer installers that have experience installing computers that have a secure internet connection. The team of project 
managers would need to have a lot of experience and knowledge in every area of network design. The software developers also need to have a lot of experience as they have to work together to create an extremely secure program that is to be run off the cloud. Not only does the program have to be secure to protect the confidential customer information, it also needs to be able to generate red flags when it sees there is a misuse or high use of prescription drugs. 
If this project idea was successful in being created it would have an enormous impact on the diverse communities in Australia, as it would see an instantaneous decrease in the prescription drug abuser community. This system will help ensure that patients are filling their prescriptions appropriately and at the recommended time by a doctor (for example, if a patient is prescribed an opioid drug, they are only able to refill this prescription every 30 days, therefore a red flag would be applied with a patient attempts to refill the script before then). This system would be one of a kind as it would be assisting with reducing the amount of prescription drug deaths and overdoses within the Australia community. This would then further assist doctors with being able to see those patients who truly need their care and attention and reduce the number of pointless visits from prescription drug abusers.
