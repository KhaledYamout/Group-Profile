Khaled Yamout

Born and raised in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia a city that was raised from the barren sands of the desert. Originally from Lebanon, enrolled at the Oxford multinational school where the first steps towards higher education began. Passionate about acting and film since childhood, after graduating from high school traveled to Lebanon to peruse an education in media studies at the Lebanese American University. In university learning so many skills and understanding progress in technology, observant that media in Lebanon was still in its most basic form. Graduated from (LAU) in 2014 to be able to continue studies abroad however, things did not go as planned. Obliged to stay, worked at an advertising company back in Riyadh where gaining work experience and profit took most of the focus from the real objective. Finally realizing the importance of going after a goal after 2 years. Applied to many production companies. There was a project in Jeddah where there was a possibility of a great position and recruitment. After the month of working on the project, the company decided to accept enlistment. A week after acceptance, managed to contact the company again asking for further detail. The company unprofessionally declined to answer and gave an intolerable excuse. A small time local production company then accepted enrollment. In the 3 months of learning all manner of aspects in media and production. The refusal of the pay rate they were offering ended in disappointment and withdrawal. After a grinding year trying to find a good job, grasped that it was time to try something new. Traveled back to Lebanon where freelancing in media gave the rise to widen and expand the skills needed. After struggling from job to job, the love for computers and technology sparked an intrigue. Now trying to study once again in the hopes of finding a stable workflow and understanding what I.T. is can reveal new opportunities.

### Team Ideal Jobs What makes them differnet and Similar (Group Skill Set)

Our ideal jobs have many similarities and differences nonetheless, it is crucial to know what they are to realize each other’s objective. There are so many functions a computer can produce though, it all differs on what, how, and which job requires a certain outcome. For instance Tayla has experience in accounting, Commerce/Banking, and consulting or advising. In her case she would need to use a computer to organize all her work and save financial data and client information. As mentioned earlier a computer not only helps organize workflow and save data but can function to create and produce works of art. Khaled a film student utilizes the computer to edit videos and so much more. Recently studying I.T. and computer sciences made him recognize that coding and programing can help him achieve things in design that were not discovered yet in his previous studies. Patrick who has an interest in Networking would use a computer in order to configure routers, troubleshooting any problems with the network, WAP’s, and help in many other ways to improve and make sure internet is accessible and smooth.

## Technology That Impact The World


## Robots


In the 80’s Robots were a thing of science fiction, they were made fun of on the T.V. when watching an old black and whited film that featured a robot. Now a days Robots manufacture and help us in so many ways in our daily lives. A robot by definition is defined as a machine that resembles a living creature by being able to move independently and performing complex tasks such as grasping or moving objects. Micheal B. Merriam Webster, Definition of Robot, Retrieved from https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/robot.
Robots were not in use until the 20th century but, the mention and the use of automation was described way before recent times. It is said that the ancient Greeks and many other civilizations used machines or “Machina” to do several tasks to make their lives easier, this was the beginning of the creation of robotics though none of the automated machines endured for proof. Thomas, History of Robotics, Retrieved from https://www.thomasnet.com/articles/automation-electronics/history-of-robotics/ .
In the Middle Ages in Europe and the Middle East automation was mostly used to make clocks and machines for ceremonial practices. There were descriptions of machines in the Arab polymath of Al Jazari (1136-1206) that indicate a large moving elephant clock that sounded every hour, a musical robot, and an automaton waitress that served drinks. (Thomas, History of Robotics) When robots were engineered in the 18th century people called them “Automata” or “Automatons” that took the form of living creatures and moved like them, also performed actions like them. (Thomas, History of Robotics) During the Industrial Revolution so many wonders of mechanics were being built for experiment and production to make tasks easier. Unfortunately not everything that was engineered at the time was successful at performing their jobs however, it kindled the minds of inventors and story makers alike. Racing N. (1880-1890), Victorian Secrets from Footnotes of History.
All the ruckus started with the creation of the steam powered man on March 24, 1868 where it is said to have the strength of 3 horses to pull a carriage. Racing N. (1880-1890). They made him look like a man so that it won’t scare other horses away but, there is another reason for making a “Robot” look human. People prefer it if robots looked human when undertaking tasks that resemble human behavior. Dr. Peter B. Why Do We Make Robots look like Humans? Retrieved from https://www.sciencefocus.com/future-technology/why-do-we-make-robots-look-like-humans/.
The Robots of today have advanced so much since then. Today a lot of robots are used for industrial manufacturing and executing labor tasks more efficiently and faster than a person can, because some tasks are either too difficult for a human to do or too dangerous. Ticara G. What Robots Are Used Today? Retrieved from https://sciencing.com/what-robots-are-used-today-12745877.html  Robots are used by NASA for instance on expeditions to explore space and go to planets such as Mars. (Ticara G.) As for the medical field robots are used to perform surgeries that are extremely complex and delicate for a surgeon’s hands. (Ticara G.)
The most recent and most modern technology used in robots is Artificial Intelligence (A.I.). This technology will revolutionize the way robots behave and think. To be able to think and learn is the real focus and objective of this tech. It will allow robots to do tasks faster and more efficiently. Sanjit S. (Feb 25, 2019) Artificial Intelligence in Humanoid Robots, Retrieved from https://www.forbes.com/sites/cognitiveworld/2019/02/25/artificial-intelligence-in-humanoid-robots/#19562af924c7. 
Making a robot in humanoid form was first made to see how to make better prosthetics for humans. (Sanjit S. Feb 25, 2019) Humanoids are now being used for so many reasons and not just or limited to research purposes. (Sanjit S. Feb 25, 2019) Now a days robots or more specifically humanoids are not only assisting with minimal tasks but rather taking on roles such as receptionist, personal assistant, and front desk officer. (Sanjit S. Feb 25, 2019) A.I. based interactions is what makes humanoids so unique. The way they receive information and are able to decipher commands, questions, and even reply in a witty manner makes them closer and closer to becoming more “human”. (Sanjit S. Feb 25, 2019)
A great example of humanoid robotics is Sophia the world’s first robot citizen, she was created by Hanson Robotics where she was presented to the United Nations on October 11, 2017. She was then given a citizenship by Saudi Arabia on October the 25th, where she became the first robot citizen. (Sanjit S. Feb 25, 2019)
The impact of this technology is already in effect, if robots are taking the roles of assisting people in day to day tasks. Then this technology is going to radically alter how humans will interact with it in the future. Depending on the tasks that Robots or humanoids are going to take in the near future could affect how everyone lives. If (A.I.) in the future can improve how robots perform in a human environment where robots take the responsibility of making sure our every needs are satisfied. Many current jobs can be replaced if given the chance to. Such as Bank clerk, receptionist, maid/butler, and the list can go on.   
A prediction to how robotics could change the future in the next 3 years could be anything. The sky is the limit when it comes to (A.I.) there is still so much a robot can be capable of, but only if we as humans grant them the permission and the means for it to evolve. If given the power to learn all that human-kind has done. Robots would be able to improve our life by perceiving faults in our day to day life. Scientist however want to limit the power of (A.I.) from learning everything. The reason for this is because they are afraid that if given the chance to learn everything, a Robot’s first primary thought would be to eliminate the problem. In this case the problem is human error, as seen in many Sci-Fi movies such as “I-Robot”. If Humanoids are already taking tasks that replace humans in some jobs like mentioned above, robots can impact our human way of life in such a drastic way that some people would be against it. The people who would need jobs and are replaced by robots are the ones who would be most affected by this movement.
In my day to day life, some tasks that prove to be annoying and arduous such as getting things from the store and or doing the laundry for instance are possible tasks for future robots that would help me. It will make my life easier to have a robot around that does not demand money for every trivial task done. Getting a Robot would help with tasks that a regular human would ask money for. In doing so would help to financially cut down on unnecessary spending, the question is, would this robot do the task better than a human would?. Members of my family would probably like the idea of help around the house, and chores like washing dishes and cooking being done by a robot. I believe that robotics can either be there to help, or make things worse for a lot of desperate people who need work but are given to robots instead. I’m trying to adapt with what’s to come however, with so much going on and the speed in which technology is changing the world, some of us might not be able to catch up.
